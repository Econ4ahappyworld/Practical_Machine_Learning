# Practical_Machine_Learning
  
This repository and the Submission Branch is the submission of Timothy Wilson for the Course Project of the Coursera Data Science Specialisation Course in the Practical Machine Learning Module.
  
Information about the data, the model that was designed and all the full submission is available in the R Markdown file.
  
I have also attempted to create a gh-pages html file so that it is easier for the markers.  This should be available here:
